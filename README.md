#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application 
of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of 
high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, 
deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in 
the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems 
that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, 
entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, 
 the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
 the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user 
interface.
 - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design 
specifications.
 - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and 
functional requirements.
 - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after 
deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methologies is linear and sequential hence each step has to be completed before the next one begins , changes are difficult and costly once  a phase is completed. It is best suited for projects with well defined requirements and low expected changes. 
Agile methodology is iterative and incremental , work is done in small repeatable cycles with contious feedack nd improvements , it is also flexible and changes can be incoroporated through out the proect , its phases overlap and are revisited freuently with continous review and adaptation 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
 - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test 
plans.
 - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):  provideS 
comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, 
IntelliJ IDEA).
 - Version Control Systems (VCS): trackS changes to source code and 
coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements , tight deadlines, technica debts . Strategies include effetive communication ,agile methodologies, prioritisation of tasks , 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
 - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user 
needs
help identify and fix defects early in the development  process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves designing and crafting the questions or instructions you give to an AI to get the best responses. It promotes clarity and efficiency 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about baking .[vague
Tell me the steps involved in baking  a round chocolate cake for 3 people with white frosting
The improved prompt enables the ai to give a specific answer that best suits the question
